# Mini Projects in Python


### 1. Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.

### 2. Spam Classification
Basic NLP project using sklearn to classify whether a message will be considered spam or not.

### 3. Movie Review Classification
NLP project that trains a Naive Bayes classifier to classify a review as positive or negative.

### 4. Text Summarization
Text summarization is the task of shortening long pieces of text into a concise summary that preserves key information, content and overall meaning of the text. This project uses HuggingFace Transformers, which offer pretrained Transformers, for performing easy text summarization. Summarization is usually done using an encoder-decoder model, such as Bart or T5. We have used both in this project.
It takes 'article.txt' file as input and outputs the summary using BART model in the 'summaryBART.txt' file and using the T5 model in 'summaryT5.txt' file. The python code is contained in the 'Text Summarization.py' file.
